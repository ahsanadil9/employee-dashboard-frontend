# Employee Management Dashboard

This project is an Employee Management Dashboard built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**, and provides an interactive interface to manage employees. It allows for the viewing, adding, editing, and deleting of employee details. The app is responsive, displaying a grid or tile layout depending on the user's preference.

It also integrates with an API service to fetch employee data and includes role-based features for user interactions.

## Technologies Used:

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety throughout the app.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern UI styling.
- **Lucide Icons**: For easy and customizable icons across the app.
- **React Hooks**: For state and effect management.

## Project Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more deployment information, refer to [Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project for full control.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium-sized deployments.

## Features

- **Employee Directory**: View employees in grid or tile format, with details such as Name, Role, Department, and more.

## Skills Tested:

- **API Integration**: Fetching data from an external API service to populate employee details and manage employee data.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety across the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Using TailwindCSS to ensure the app looks great on all screen sizes.
